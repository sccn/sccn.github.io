Future EEGLAB workshops
===
Below are EEGLAB workshops currently planned

In 2025:
- The workshop in San Diego, USA (UCSD campus) in November was canceled.
- There is a workshop in Marseille, France, at the end of October 2025 as part of the [PracticalMEEG conference](https://cuttingeeg.org/practicalmeeg2025/).

Do not forget to subscribe to the EEGLAB News list to be notified of new
workshop and registration information (you may register by clicking a
checkbox when downloading EEGLAB).

If you are interested in hosting a non-profit workshop (involving at
least 40 participants), please contact us at <eeglab@sccn.ucsd.edu>. If
you want to organize a local event, we will be happy to provide
Powerpoint material and names of possible nearby tutors.

An [Online EEGLAB
Workshop](/workshops/Online_EEGLAB_Workshop) is also
currently available and will be enhanced.
