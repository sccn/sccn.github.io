EEGLAB Workshop
============================

<span style="color: blue">Aspet France - June 30-July 4th, 2025
</span>
The 34th EEGLAB Workshop will take place at the Bois Perche, about two hours by
chartered bus from Toulouse. Participants will be expected to bring laptops with
MATLAB installed so as to be able to participate in the practical
sessions. The tutorial workshop will introduce and demonstrate the use
of the EEGLAB software environment and EEGLAB-linked tools for
performing advanced analysis of EEG and related data, with detailed
method expositions and practical exercises. There will be an excursion.

A Free symposium on Cloud EEG data processing will precede the workshop in Toulouse.

Registration and cost
---------------------
Space at the workshop is limited to about 40 participants.

To reimburse travel expenses of Workshop faculty and facilities rental,
costs for the workshop will be as follows:

Registration cost is 300 Euros for students and post-docs, 500 Euros for
faculty and other professionals. These registration costs include
conference space rental, all coffee breaks, and a short excursion. 
When registering, participants are also expected to pay for accommodation and all meals to the Bois Perche retreat center (a total of 470 euros). Because of a grant from the CNRS, registration (although not accommodation) is free for participants from French laboratories, while through a CRNS grant accommodations are also free for CNRS employees.

<b>Warning: </b> This workshop is <em>not</em> aimed for real beginners
in EEG - such persons would be wasting much of their time.
Some parts of the workshop are fairly technical. The main topics will be
advanced methods for analyzing EEG and allied behavioral data, methods
including spectral decomposition, independent component analysis,
inverse source analysis, information flow, etc.. Some other parts of the
workshop will require basic MATLAB scripting capabilities. Some basic
web resources for learning MATLAB are discussed below. Beginners may
also gain experience using MATLAB by applying the steps discussed in the
EEGLAB wiki tutorial to the sample dataset which you can freely
download.

MATLAB tutorial
----------------

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to writing EEGLAB scripts -- Not being able
to understand MATLAB syntax will mean you will miss out on a large
portion of the workshop.

If you are new to MATLAB or need a refresher, please consult the material on the [Getting started with MATLAB page](/tutorials/misc/tutorial_matlab.html)

If you do not have MATLAB, you can obtain a 30-day trial license for free on the [mathworks website](https://www.mathworks.com/campaigns/products/trials.html).

Workshop Program (with corresponding PDFs)
------------------------------------------

<b>Material for workshop tutorials (including EEGLAB) will be made available on
USB keys.</b> Presented slides will be made
available during the workshop. You only need to bring a
laptop with MATLAB installed.
