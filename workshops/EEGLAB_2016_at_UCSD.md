The 22nd EEGLAB Workshop
========================

<font color=blue>La Jolla, California, USA - November 17-21, 2016
following the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego</font>
The 22nd EEGLAB Workshop will take place from Thursday evening, November
17th through Monday, November 21st at San Diego Supercomputer Center of
the University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA. Participants
will be expected to bring laptops with Matlab installed so as to be able
to participate in the practical sessions. The workshop will introduce
and demonstrate the use of EEGLAB and EEGLAB plug-in tools for
performing analysis of EEG and related data, with overview talks on
principles of EEG data analysis, detailed method expositions, and
practical exercises. The program begins with an open house reception and
poster sharing session the evening of the 17th (5:00-8:00 pm) , the day
following the Society for Neuroscience meeting in downtown San Diego, 25
minutes away. The workshop will end at 12:00 pm noon on Monday, Nov.
21st.

For any questions, please contact <eeglab@sccn.ucsd.edu>.

NEW: Collaboration Survey
-------------------------

We at SCCN are planning to apply for a P-41 grant from NIH to create an
<b>NIBIB Biomedical Technology Resource Center for advanced EEG data
analysis</b> and are seeking research partners with clinical interests.
Please fill out the following survey if you are interested in
participating.

Potential benefits to research partners include: intensive technical
support, custom-made MoBI systems, algorithm development, and
collaboration; with the possibility of applying for grant supplements
for your work).

<i>Note: Many birds-of-a-feather group dinners will be devoted to
discussing this opportunity further--please sign up if interested after
you've filled out the survey. Thank you.</i>

San Diego and UCSD
------------------

Although less than 60 years old, the [University of California, San
Diego](http://ucsd.edu/), sister to UCLA, UC Berkeley, and seven other
UC campuses, is now an American research powerhouse. Located by the
beaches and spectacular cliffs of La Jolla, UCSD enjoys near year-round
temperate weather.

Registration and cost
---------------------

workshop, costs to participants are as follows: Registration is <b>$350
for students and post-docs</b> and <b>$500 for faculty and others</b>.
This includes

-   Conference space rental for 4 days
-   Registration packet and perks
-   Continental breakfast and coffee breaks
-   Covering travel/accommodation expenses for some of the speakers
-   Note that this is a non-profit event; none of the faculty are
    compensated

    Natural Reserve](http://torreypine.org/).

Accommodations are not included.

<b><span style="color: red">The workshop is completely full </span></b>

Accommodation
-------------

We made arrangements with La Jolla hotels for rooms during the workshop.
We will open a mailing list closer to the workshop for people who might
be interested in sharing a room to reduce cost.

-   Preferred: There is a room block we have blocked at a negotiated
    EEGLAB WORKSHOP discounted rate for the first 30 registrants at a
    rate of $159 (yes it is a discounted rate from the regular $202
    rate). You may receive the discounted rate 2 days before and after
    the event. Click on this

Food
----

cover their own food expenses. We have compiled a [list of
restaurants](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/githubwiki/files/listofrestaurants.pdf) in the area.
Location of the workshop
------------------------

The address of the venue is "10100 Hopkins Drive, San Diego, California
92121." Click [here](/media:map.png "wikilink") to download the map for

Poster session
--------------

The poster space is available on a first come first serve basis.
Presenters may have their posters displayed between 4:30pm-5:45pm on
Nov. 17. Be warned that all posters left after the reception may not be
returned to the presenter, and we will not be able to mail the poster
after the workshop. We will have 20 posters in synthesis and 10 posters
in the INC open area (directions will be provided on site).

Laptop for the workshop
-----------------------

Please bring a laptop with Matlab installed (no extra toolboxes required
although the signal processing, statistics and optimization toolboxes
are recommanded). Laptop must have at the very least 4Gb of RAM. The
version of Matlab should be later than 7.x. We will share USB flash
drive at the workshop to distribute material for practicum. There is no
need to install EEGLAB prior to the workshop.

Matlab Tutorial (for novice users only)
---------------------------------------

EEGLAB graphic interface is built on top of the powerful Matlab
scripting language. Enjoying the full capabilities of EEGLAB for
building macro commands and performing custom and automated processing
requires the ability to manipulate EEGLAB data structures in Matlab.
Because of time constrains, we will NOT provide an introduction to the
Matlab language. Instead users need to familiarize themselves with
Matlab prior to the workshop. Users of Matlab 7: we recommend running
the following demos and reading the following help sections.

After opening the Matlab desktop, select menu item "Help" and run the
"Getting Started with MATLAB" tutorial. Each of the 10 sections hould
take you about 2 to 5 minutes, for a total here of about 1 hour.
IMPORTANT NOTE: A portion of the workshop will be dedicated to writing
EEGLAB scripts, so not being able to understand Matlab syntax will
result in you missing out on a portion of the workshop.

More reading (recommended)
--------------------------

To familiarize yourself with EEGLAB, first read The EEGLAB Tutorial (see
link below) and the main EEGLAB Methods paper (also available from the
EEGLAB site). You might also want to peruse recent EEG papers using
EEGLAB to understand more about the motivation for some of the core
capabilities (ICA, time/frequency analysis, trial-by-trial
visualization) that are already built into EEGLAB. The EEGLAB wiki is
available at

<http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB>

In our experience, the more you already know before attending the
workshop, the more you benefit from it.

Material for download
---------------------

Material for download will be provided on USB flash drives during the
workshop. All presentations will be uploaded on this page (see links
below in the program).

Multi-track program
-------------------

This workshop featured a three-track design. Each afternoon, lectures to
the whole group will be alternated with smaller sessions in three
tracks. Attendees new to EEGLAB may choose the basic EEGLAB instruction
track to gain practical experience in using it. Attendees familiar with
EEGLAB may join sessions on newer, more advanced EEGLAB toolboxes and
related software (see below).
