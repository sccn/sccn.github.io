EEGLAB Data Structures
=======================
{: .no_toc }

This section is intended for users who wish to [use EEGLAB and its
functions in MATLAB scripts](/tutorials/ConceptsGuide/EEGLAB_functions.html). We have tried
to make EEG structures as simple and as transparent as possible so that
advanced users can use them to efficiently process their data.

Introduction
------------

Writing EEGLAB MATLAB scripts requires some understanding of the
EEGLAB data structure (EEG) and its substructures (principally
*EEG.data*, *EEG.event*, *EEG.urevent*, *EEG.epoch*, *EEG.chanlocs* and
*EEG.history*). We will introduce EEGLAB data structures below.

- EEG: the current EEG dataset
- ALLEEG: array of all loaded EEG datasets
- CURRENTSET: the index of the current dataset
- LASTCOM: the last command issued from the EEGLAB menu
- ALLCOM: all the commands issued from the EEGLAB menu
- STUDY: the EEGLAB group analysis structure
- CURRENTSTUDY: 1 if EEGLAB performing group analysis, 0 otherwise

Note that EEGLAB does not use global variables (the variables above are
accessible from the command line but they are not used as global
variables within EEGLAB). The above variables are ordinary variables in
the global MATLAB workspace. All EEGLAB functions except the main interactive window function [eeglab.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeglab.m) (and a few other
display functions) process one or more of these variables explicitly as
input parameters and do not access or modify any global variable. This
ensures that they have a minimum chance of producing unwanted 'side
effects'.

EEG and ALLEEG
---------------
EEGLAB variable *EEG* is a MATLAB structure that contains all the
information about the current EEGLAB dataset. For instance, select menu item <span style="color: brown">File</span> and press sub-menu item
<span style="color: brown">Load existing dataset</span>. Select the tutorial file "eeglab_data_epochs_ica.set" located in the "sample_data" folder of EEGLAB. Then press *Open*. Then typing *\>\>EEG* will produce the following command
line output:

``` matlab
>> EEG

    EEG =
             setname: 'EEG Data epochs'
            filename: 'eeglab_data_epochs_ica.set'
            filepath: '/data/matlab/eeglab/sample_data/'
             subject: ''
               group: ''
           condition: ''
             session: []
            comments: [9x769 character]
              nbchan: 32
              trials: 80
                pnts: 384
               srate: 128

               epoch: [1×80 struct]
    epochdescription: {}
              reject: [1×1 struct]
               stats: [1×1 struct]
            specdata: []
          specicaact: []
          splinefile: []
       icasplinefile: ''
              dipfit: []
             history: ''
               saved: 'yes'
                 etc: [1×1 struct]
             datfile: 'eeglab_data_epochs_ica.fdt'
                 run: []
```

See the help message
of the [eeg_checkset.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_checkset.m) function (which checks the consistency
of EEGLAB datasets) for the meaning of all the fields.

EEGLAB variable *ALLEEG* is a MATLAB array that holds all the datasets
in the current EEGLAB/MATLAB workspace. In fact *ALLEEG* is a structure
array of *EEG* datasets (described above). If, in the current EEGLAB
session you have one datasets loaded, *ALLEEG* will be equal to *EEG*. If you have two datasets loaded, typing *\>\> ALLEEG* on the MATLAB
command line returns:

``` matlab
ALLEEG =
    1x2 struct array with fields:
        setname
        filename
        filepath
        pnts
        nbchan
        trials
        srate
        xmin
        xmax
        data
        icawinv
        icasphere
        icaweights
        icaact
        event
        epoch
        chanlocs
        comments
        averef
        rt

        stats
        splinefile
        ref
        history
        urevent
        times
```

Typing *\>\> ALLEEG(1)* returns the structure of the first dataset in
ALLEEG, and typing *\>\> ALLEEG(2)* returns the structure of the second
dataset. See the [using EEGLAB history](/tutorials/11_Scripting/Using_EEGLAB_history.html) section of the tutorial for more
information on manipulating these structures.
Most fields of the *EEG* structure contain single values (as detailed in
[eeg_checkset.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_checkset.m)). However some important fields of the *EEG*
structure contain sub-structures. We will describe briefly three of
those below: *EEG.chanlocs*, *EEG.event*, and *EEG.epoch*.

### EEG.chanlocs

This EEG-structure field stores information about the EEG channel
locations and channel names. For example, loading the tutorial dataset
and typing *\>\> EEG.chanlocs* returns

``` matlab
>> EEG.chanlocs

    ans =
    1x32 struct array with fields:
        theta
        radius
        labels
        sph_theta
        sph_phi
        sph_radius
        X
        Y
        Z
```

Here, *EEG.chanlocs* is a structure array of length 32 (one record for
each of the 32 channels in this dataset). 

Typing *\>\>EEG.chanlocs(1)*
returns:

``` matlab
>> EEG.chanlocs(1)

    ans =
        theta:      0
        radius:     0.4600
        labels:     'FPz'
        sph_theta:  0
        sph_phi:    7.200
        sph_radius: 1
        X:      0.9921
        Y:      0
        Z:      0.1253
```

These values store the channel location coordinates and label of the
first channel ('FPz'). You may use the [pop_chanedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_chanedit.m)
function or menu item <span style="color: brown">Edit → Channel locations</span>
to edit or recompute the channel location information. The value of any
EEG structure field may also be modified manually from the MATLAB
command line. See also the tutorial section on importing [channel locations](/tutorials/04_Import/Channel_Locations.html).

### EEG.event

The *EEG* structure field contains records of the experimental events that
occurred while the data was being recorded, plus possible additional
user-defined events. Loading the tutorial dataset and typing:

``` matlab
>> EEG.event

    ans =
        1x157 struct array with fields:
            type
            position
            latency
            urevent
            epoch
```

In general, fields *type*, *latency*, and *urevent* are always present
in the event structure:

- *type* contains the event type
- *latency* contains the event latency in data sample unit
- *urevent* contains the
index of the event in the original (= 'ur') urevent table (see below).

Other fields like *position* are user defined and are specific to the
experiment. 

The user may also define a field called *duration*
(recognized by EEGLAB) for defining the duration of the event (if
portions of the data have been deleted, the field *duration* is added
automatically to store the duration of the break (i.e. boundary) event).

If epochs have been extracted from the dataset, another field, *epoch*,
is added to store the index of the data epoch(s) the event belongs to.

To learn more about the EEGLAB event structure, see the [event
scripting tutorial](/tutorials/11_Scripting/Event_Processing_command_line.html).

There is also a separate 'ur' (German for 'original') event structure,
*EEG.urevent*, which holds all the event
information that was originally loaded into the dataset plus events that
were manually added by the user. When continuous data is first loaded,
the content of this structure is identical to contents of the
*EEG.event* structure (minus the *urevent* pointer field of
*EEG.event*). However, as users remove events from the dataset through
artifact rejection or extract epochs from the data, some of the original
(ur) events continue to exist only in the urevent structure.

The *urevent* field in the EEG.event structure above contains the index
of the same event in the *EEG.urevent* structure array. For example: If
a portion of the data containing the second urevent were removed from a
dataset during artifact rejection, the second event would <u>not</u>
remain in the *EEG.event* structure -- but would still remain in the
*EEG.urevent* structure. Now, the second event left in the data might be
the original third event, and so will be linked to the third
*EEG.urevent*, i.e. checking

``` matlab
>> EEG.event(2).urevent

    ans =
        3
```

#### Event types

Event fields of the current data structure can be displayed by typing
''\>\> EEG.event '' on the MATLAB command line. 
To display the field values for the first event, type:

``` matlab
>> EEG.event(1)

ans =
    type: 'square'
    position: 2
    latency: 129.087
    urevent: 1
```

Remember that custom event fields can be added to the event structure
and will thereafter be imported with the event information whenever the
dataset is loaded. Therefore, the names of some event fields may differ
in different datasets. Note that event field information can be easily
retrieved using commands such as *\>\> {EEG.event.fieldname}*. For
example,

``` matlab
>> {EEG.event(1:5).type}
```

returns the contents of the *type* field for the first 5 events:

``` matlab
ans =
    'square' 'square' 'rt' 'square' 'rt'
```

Use the following commands to list the different event types in the
unprocessed tutorial dataset:

``` matlab
>> unique({EEG.event.type});

ans=
    'rt' 'square'
```

The command above assumes that event types are recorded as strings. Use
*\>\> unique(cell2mat({EEG.event.type}));* for event types stored as
numbers.

You may then use the recovered event type names to extract epochs. Below
is the command-line equivalent of the epoch extraction procedure
presented above in section [extracting data
epochs](/tutorials/07_Extract_epochs/Extracting_Data_Epochs.html).

``` matlab
>> EEG = pop_epoch( EEG, { 'square' }, \[-1 2\], 'epochinfo', 'yes');
```

#### Event latencies

We may use the same command as in the section above to display the
contents of the event latency field. Event latencies are stored in units
of data sample points relative to (1) the beginning of the continuous
data matrix (EEG.data). For the tutorial dataset (before any
processing), typing:

``` matlab
>> [EEG.event(1:5).latency]

ans =
     129.0087 218.0087 267.5481 603.0087 659.9726
```

To see these latencies in seconds (instead of sample points above), you
need first to convert this cell array to an ordinary numeric array, then subtract 1 (because
the first sample point corresponds to time 0) and divide by the sampling
rate. Therefore,

``` matlab
>> ([EEG.event(1:5).latency]-1)/EEG.srate

ans =
    1.0001 1.6954 2.0824 4.7032 5.1482
```

For consistency, for epoched datasets, the event latencies are also
encoded in sample points with respect to the beginning of the data (as
if the data were continuous). Thus, after extracting epoch from the
[data
epoch extraction](/tutorials/07_Extract_epochs/Extracting_Data_Epochs.html) tutorial, look at the first 5 event latencies:

``` matlab
>> {EEG.event(1:5).latency}

ans =
     129 218.00 267.5394 424 513 
``` 

Note that for an epoched dataset this information has no direct meaning.
Instead, select menu item <span style="color: brown">Edit → Event values</span> (calling function [pop_editeventvals.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_editeventvals.m)) to display the
latency of this event in seconds relative to the epoch time-locking
event. From the command-line, you may use the function [eeg_point2lat.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_point2lat.m) to convert the given latencies from data
points relative to the beginning of the data to latencies in seconds
relative to the epoch time-locking event. For example:

``` matlab
>> eeg_point2lat(cell2mat({EEG.event(1:5).latency}), cell2mat({EEG.event(1:5).epoch}), EEG.srate, [EEG.xmin EEG.xmax])

ans =
    0 0.6953 1.0823 -0.6953 0
```

The reverse conversion can be accomplished using function [eeg_lat2point.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_lat2point.m).

The most useful function for obtaining event information from the command-line is EEGLAB function [eeg_getepochevent.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_getepochevent.m). This
function may be used for both continuous and epoch data to retrieve any
event field for any event type. For example, using the tutorial data
(after epoch extraction), type in:

``` matlab
>> [rt_lat all_rt_lat] = eeg_getepochevent(EEG, 'rt', [], 'latency');
```

to obtain the latency of events of type *rt*. The first output is an
array containing one value per data epoch (the *first* event of the
specified type in each data epoch). The second output is a cell array
containing the field values for *all* the relevant events in each data
epoch. Latency information is returned in milliseconds. (Note: The third
input allows searching for events in a specific time window within each
epoch. An empty value indicates that the whole epoch time range should
be used).
Similarly, to obtain the value of the event 'position' field for 'square'
events in each epoch, type:

``` matlab
>> [rt_lat, all_rt_lat] = eeg_getepochevent(EEG, 'square', [], 'position');
```

Continuous data behave as a single data epoch, so type:

``` matlab
>> [~, all_sq_lat] = eeg_getepochevent(EEG, 'square');
```

to obtain the latencies of all 'square' events in the continuous data
(via the second output).

#### Ur-events

A separate 'ur' (German for 'original') event
structure, *EEG.urevent*, holds all the event information originally
loaded into the dataset. If some events or data regions containing
events are removed from the data, this should not affect the
*EEG.urevent* structure. If some new events are inserted into the
dataset, the urevent structure is automatically updated. This is useful
to obtain information on the *context* of events in the original
experiment. Even after extracting data epochs, the prior *context* of
each event in a continuous or epoched dataset is still available.
Currently, the *EEG.urevent* structure can only be examined from the
command line.

The *EEG.urevent* structure has the same format as the *EEG.event*
structure. The *urevent* field in the event structure (e.g.,
*EEG.event(n).urevent*) contains the index of the corresponding event in
the urevent structure array -- thereby 'pointing' from the event to its
corresponding urevent, e.g., its 'original event' number in the
continuous data event stream. For example, if a portion of data
containing the second event is removed from a continuous dataset during
artifact rejection, the second event will not remain in the *EEG.event*
structure. It *will* remain, however, in the *EEG.urevent* structure.
e.g., the second *EEG.event* might now point to the third *EEG.urevent*:

``` matlab
>> EEG.event(2).urevent

ans =
    3
```

Note that *urevent* indices in the *EEG.event* structure do not have to
increase linearly. For example, after epochs were extracted from the
tutorial dataset,

``` matlab
>> {EEG.event(1:5).urevent}

ans =
    [1] [2] [3] [1] [2]
```

This means that events 1 and 2 (in the first data epoch) and events 4
and 5 (in the second data epoch) are the same original
events.

A few EEGLAB command-line functions use the *urevent* structure: [eeg_time2prev.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_time2prev.m), [eeg_urlatency.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_urlatency.m) and
[eeg_context.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_context.m). The next
section provides more insight into the relation between the *EEG.event*
and *EEG.urevent* structures.

#### Event boundaries

Events of reserved type 'boundary' are created automatically by EEGLAB
when portions of the data are rejected from continuous data or when
continuous datasets are concatenated. These events indicate the
latencies and (when possible) the durations of the discontinuities these
operations introduce in the data. In the image below, a portion of data
that included event \#2 was rejected, and a type 'boundary' event was
added to the event structure. Its index became 2, since events are
sorted by their latencies. The urevent structure continues to hold the
original event information, with no added 'boundary' event.


![Image:Eventcontinuous.gif](/assets/images/Eventcontinuous.gif)

The latency of a 'boundary' event is usually between two samples. For example, if samples 101 to 200 are removed, then the latency of the 'boundary'  event will be 100.5, indicating with no ambiguity that sample 101 was removed while we kept sample 100. Also,  'boundary' event durations indicate the number of samples removed (in the example above, 100 of them). Storing this information allows determining how much data was removed. When merging datasets, 'boundary' event duration is irrelevant and set to NaN.

Note that boundary events are allowed latencies outside of the data range. If the data has 1000 samples, the sample limit is 1 to 1000 (MATLAB starts at sample 1). Events at latency 0.5 and 1000.5 of type 'boundary' are allowed outside the data limits. These boundary events indicate that data has been removed at the onset or the end of the data, and the duration field indicates how much data was removed.

Boundary events are standard event structures with *event.type* =
'boundary'. They also have an *event.duration* field that holds the
duration of the rejected data portion (in data samples). Note that since
all events in a dataset must have the same set of fields, in datasets
containing boundary events, every event will have a 'duration' field --
set by default to 0 or empty except for true boundary type events. Boundary
events are used by several signal processing functions that process
continuous data. For example, calculating the data spectrum in the [pop_spectopo.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_spectopo.m) function operates only on continuous portions
of the data (between boundary events). Also, data epoching functions
will not extract epochs that contain a boundary event.

*Epoched* datasets do not have boundary events between data epochs.
Instead of being stored in a 2-D array of size (channels, sample_points)
like continuous data, epoched data is stored in a 3-D array of size
(channels, sample_points, trials). Events in data epochs are stored as
if the data were continuous, in effect treating the data as a 2-D array
of size (channels, (sample_points\*trials)). This format makes handling
events from the command-line more convenient.

The purpose of the *EEG.urevent* structure is to retain the full record
of experimental events from the original continuous data, as shown in the image below. Function [eeg_context.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_context.m) uses *urevents*
information to find events defined by their neighboring event context
in the experiment (and original data).

![Image:Eventepoch.gif](/assets/images/Eventepoch.gif)

**'Hard' boundaries between datasets**. When continuous datasets are concatenated, a 'harder' type of boundary
event must be inserted, this time into both the *EEG.event* and
*EEG.urevent* structures. In particular, if the first urevent in the
pair was the last event in one dataset, and the next urevent was the
first event in the next concatenated dataset (which need not have been
recorded at the same time), the latencies of the neighboring pair of
urevents cannot be compared directly. Such so-called 'hard' boundary
events marking the joint between concatenated datasets have the usual
type 'boundary' but a special 'duration' value, *NaN* (MATLAB numeric
value 'not-a-number'). They are the only 'boundary' events present in
*EEG.urevent* and are the only type 'boundary' events in *EEG.event*
with a 'duration' of 'NaN' and an *EEG.event.urevent* pointer to an
urevent. Hard 'boundary' events are important for functions such as [eeg_context.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_context.m) that are concerned with temporal relationships
among events in the original experiment (i.e., among urevents).

### EEG.epoch

The *EEG.epoch* structure is empty in continuous datasets but is
automatically filled during epoch extraction. It is computed from the *EEG.event* structure by the function [eeg_checkset.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_checkset.m) (with
flag 'eventconsistency') as a convenience for users who may want to use
it in writing EEGLAB scripts. One of the few EEGLAB functions that use
the *EEG.epoch* structure is [eeg_context.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=eeg_context.m). Each *EEG.epoch* entry lists the type and
*epoch* latency (in msec) of every event that occurred during the epoch.
The following example was run on the tutorial set after it was converted
to data epochs.

``` matlab
>> EEG.epoch

ans =
    1x80 struct array with fields:
        event
        eventlatency
        eventposition
        eventtype
        eventurevent
```

Note that this dataset contains 80 epochs (or trials). Now type:

``` matlab
>> EEG.epoch(1)

ans =
    event: [1 2 3]
    eventlatency: {[0] [695.3125] [1.0823e+03]}
    eventposition: {[2] [2] [2]}
    eventtype: {'square' 'square' 'rt'}
    eventurevent: {[1] [2] [3]}
```

The first field *EEG.epoch(1).event* contains the indices of all events
that occurred during this epoch. The fields *EEG.epoch(1).eventtype*,
*EEG.epoch(1).eventposition*, and *EEG.epoch(1).eventlatency* are cell
arrays containing the event field values of each of the events in that
epoch. Note that the latencies in *EEG.epoch(1).eventlatency* are in
milliseconds with respect to the epoch time-locking event. 

Some datasets contain *EEG.epoch.eventduration*,  the duration of the 
events in milliseconds. Note that this format is different from 
*EEG.event.duration*, which is stored as frames (but displayed in
seconds or milliseconds).

When extracting epochs, it is possible to remove all but a selected set
of events from the data. For example, if there is only one event in an
epoch, the epoch table may look more readable. Using the tutorial
dataset after extracting data epochs, select item <span style="color: brown">Edit → Select epoch/event</span> in the menu, and then enter (in the pop-up
window below) 'rt' in the *Event type* field, then select *Keep only
selected events and remove all other events* instead of *Remove epochs
not referenced by any event*. Press *Ok* to create a new data set. Note:
This daughter (and its future child datasets, if any) contains no trace
(except in *EEG.urevent*) of all the events that actually occurred
during the experiment but were erased by this process.

![Image:Pop_selectevent.jpg](/assets/images/Pop_selectevent.jpg)

then typing

``` matlab
>> EEG.epoch(1)
```

returns

``` matlab

ans =
    event: 1
    eventlatency: 1.0823e+03
    eventposition: 2
    eventtype: 'rt'
    eventurevent: 3
```

This means that epoch number 1 contains a single event of type 'rt' at
latency 1082.3 ms. It also indicates that this is the first event in the
dataset (i.e., *event: 1*), but note that it was the third event in the
original dataset, since its corresponding urevent (stored in
*EEG.event.urevent*) is 3.

### Saved .set files

EEGLAB datasets are saved in *.set* files. *.set* files are MATLAB files. You may save an EEG structure using the command.

```matlab
save -mat myfile.set EEG
```

This would be a valid dataset file for EEGLAB. Another supported format is to save the content of the structure itself (default as of EEGLAB 2021).

```matlab
save -mat myfile.set -struct EEG
```

Yet another supported format is to save two files. One file that contains metadata (with extension .set, and is a type of MATLAB file), and one file containing raw data (float32 with .fdt extension). The raw data file is organized in samples x channels (so first all the data for one channel, then all the data for a second channel, etc.). In case, there are several trials, the raw data file is organized in samples x trials x channels. This is equivalent to the following MATLAB commands.
Another format for the raw data file (with extension .dat) was to save the data transposed compared to the .fdt file. This format was discontinued more than a decade ago, but can still be read by EEGLAB.

```matlab
data = EEG.data;
EEG.data = 'myfile.fdt';
floatwrite(data(:,:)', 'myfile.fdt');
save -mat myfile.set EEG
```

There are additional checks performed by the function [pop_loadset.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_loadset.m), so it is always recommended to read EEGLAB datasets using this function.

```matlab
EEG = pop_loadset('myfile.set')
```

The STUDY structure
---------
This section gives details of EEGLAB structures necessary for writing
custom MATLAB scripts, functions, and plugins that operate on EEGLAB
STUDY structures and studysets.

The *STUDY* structure contains information for each of its datasets,
plus additional information to allow the processing of all datasets
sequentially. Below is a prototypical *STUDY* structure. In this tutorial, the
examples shown were collected from analysis of a small sample studyset
comprising ten datasets, two conditions from each of five subjects, which you may download [here](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download/STUDY5subjects.zip) (1.8
GB).
After loading a studyset (see previous sections, or as described below)using the function [pop_loadstudy.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_loadstudy.m), typing *STUDY* on MATLAB
command line will produce results like this:

``` matlab
>> STUDY

STUDY =
    name:       'N400STUDY'
    filename:   'N400.study'
    filepath:   '/eeglab/data/N400/'
    datasetinfo:    [1x10 struct]
    session:    []
    subject:    {1x5 cell}
    group:      {'old' 'young'}
    condition:  {'non-synonyms' 'synonyms'}
    setind:     [2x5 double]
    cluster:    [1x40 struct]
    notes:      ' '
    task:       'Auditory task: Synonyms Vs. Non-synonyms, N400'
    history:    [1x4154 char]
    etc:        [1x1 struct]
```

The field *STUDY.datasetinfo* is an array of structures whose length is
the number of datasets in the *STUDY*. Each structure stores information
about one of the datasets, including its subject, condition, session,
and group labels. It also includes a pointer to the dataset file itself
(*as explained below in more detail*).

*STUDY.datasetinfo* sub-fields *subject*, *group*, *session* and
*condition* label the subject, subject group, session, and condition
associated with each dataset in the study. This information must be
provided by the user when the *STUDY* structure is created. Otherwise,
default values are assumed.

The *STUDY.cluster* field is an array of cluster structures, initialized
when the *STUDY* is created and updated after clustering is performed
(*as explained below in more detail*). After clustering the independent components, each of the identified components in each dataset is assigned to one component cluster (in addition to
Cluster 1 that contains all components identified for clustering).

The *STUDY.history* field is equivalent to the *history* field of the
*EEG* structure. It stores all the command line calls to the functions
from the gui. For basic script writing using command history
information, see the [using EEGLAB history](/tutorials/11_Scripting/Using_EEGLAB_history.html) section of the tutorial.

The *STUDY.etc* field contains internal information that helps manage
the use of the *STUDY* structure by the clustering functions. In
particular, pre-clustering data are stored there before clustering is
performed.

### The STUDY.datasetinfo sub-structure
The *STUDY.datasetinfo* field is used for holding information on the
datasets that are part of the study. Below is an example *datasetinfo*
structure, one that holds information about the first dataset in the
*STUDY*:

``` matlab
>> STUDY.datasetinfo(1)

    ans =
        filepath:   '/eeglab/data/N400/S01/'
        filename:   'syn01-S253-clean.set'
        subject:    'S01'
        group:      'young'
        condition:  'synonyms'
        session:    1
        trialinfo:  [1×426 struct]
        comps:      [3 5 6 7 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 21 24 25 28 29 34 35 44 52]
        index:      1
```

This information was posted when the *STUDY* was created by the user.

The *datasetinfo.filepath* and *datasetinfo.filename* fields give the
location of the dataset on disk.

The *datasetinfo.subject* field attaches a subject code to the dataset.
Note: Multiple datasets from the same subject belonging to a *STUDY* are
stored under different *datasetinfo* entries and are usually distinguished
as being in different experimental conditions and/or as representing
different experimental sessions.

The *datasetinfo.group* field attaches a subject group label to the
dataset.

The *datasetinfo.condition* and *datasetinfo.session* fields hold
dataset condition and session labels. If the *condition* field is empty,
all datasets are assumed to represent the same condition. If the
*session* field is empty, all datasets in the same condition are assumed
to have been recorded in different sessions.

The *datasetinfo.index* field holds the dataset index in the *ALLEEG*
vector of currently-loaded dataset structures. It is redundant but
useful when the the substructure is used as input to another function
(i.e., *datasetinfo.index = 1* must correspond to *ALLEEG(1)*, *datasetinfo.index =
2* to *ALLEEG(2)*, etc).

The *datasetinfo.comps* field holds indices of the components of the
dataset that have been designated for clustering. When it is empty, all
of its components are to be clustered.

The *datasetinfo.trialinfo* field holds information about each data
trial. It is empty for continuous data. This field allow to create
contrast between trials within a given dataset and is described below.

``` matlab
>> STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(1)

ans =
  struct with fields:

           chan: 0
    description: 'syn'
       duration: 128
         points: 1
           type: 'S253'
```

The fields in the trialinfo data structure mirror the field in the event
structure of the datasets (the fields are the same as in *EEG.event*). The
field 'type' contains the type of stimulus. The fields 'duration'
indicates the duration of presentation of the stimulus in samples. Other
fields ('chan', 'description', 'points') contain information specific to
a given dataset. In general, a different dataset will contain different
fields. 

### The STUDY.design sub-structure
For the purpose of performing inference testing, any (m x n) design is
possible (including choosing independent variables from among
conditions, groups, sessions, particular stimulus-related trials, or
other trial subsets). Below is a description of the *STUDY* design fields.

This is the current (v2019) STUDY.design sub-structure:

``` matlab
>> STUDY.design(1)

  ans =
             name: 'Design 1 - compare letter types'
         variable: [1x2 struct]
            cases: [1x1 struct]
         filepath: ''
          include: {}
```

Exploding the contents of each of these sub-structures, we obtain

``` matlab
             name: 'Design 1 - light and audio all subjects'

         variable: [1x2 struct]
                 label: 'condition'
               pairing: 'on'
                 value: {'ignore'  'memorize'  'probe'}
               vartype: 'categorical'

           cases: [1x1 struct]
              label: 'subject'
              value: {'S01'  'S02'  'S03'  'S04'  'S05'  'S06' }

         include: {}
```

-   The 'variable' field stands for 'independent variable.' Currently,
    up to two independent variables may be defined when using EEGLAB
    standard plotting functions (when using the LIMO extension to EEGLAB
    for calculating statistics and plotting results, an arbitrary number
    of independent variables may be used). STUDY.design(x).variable(1)
    contains the description of the first independent variable for STUDY
    design number x, and STUDY.design(x).variable(2) contains the
    description of the second independent variable (if any). Each
    independent variable has a 'label', a pairing status ('on', for
    paired data and 'off' for unpaired data), associated values, and a
    type (categorical or continuous - note that continuous variable are
    only relevant when using the LIMO extension to EEGLAB). For
    instance, in this specific example the independent variable
    'condition' may take the values 'ignore', 'memorize' and 'probe'. As
    detailed in the graphic interface STUDY.design section, values may
    be combined by concatenating the value labels and separating them
    with a '-' character. For instance 'memorize - probe' is a new value
    for the variable 'condition' and it points to datasets containing
    either the 'memorize' or the 'probe' stimuli.

-   The 'cases' field contains the descriptions of the single 'cases' (a
    term adopted in statistics from clinical studies). Using the current
    interface, it is not possible to define 'cases' other than subjects
    (although when plotting single subjects, selecting the option to use
    single trials for statistics automatically makes 'cases' equivalent
    to 'trials').

-   The 'filepath' field is the path where the data files are being
    stored.

-   The 'include' field is a list of independent variables and values to
    include in the design - for instance, to include 'memorize' stimuli
    only (and ignore all subject datasets (or, for single-trial
    statistics, all trials) that do not have this independent variable
    value.

#### Definition of *STUDY* design independent variables

Most independent variables are defined in the main *STUDY* interface when
creating a STUDY. 'condition', 'group' and 'session' are independent
variables defined in the first *STUDY* editing GUI. In addition to these
variables, EEGLAB extracts independent variables for each subset of data
epochs based on epoch field information for the time-locking event in
each dataset. The function [std_maketrialinfo.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=std_maketrialinfo.m) creates the
'trialinfo' substructure in *STUDY.datasetinfo*. For instance, the first
dataset in the *STUDY* may have the properties:

``` matlab
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).condition = 'a';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).group = 'g1';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(1).presentation = 'evoked';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(2).presentation = 'evoked';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(3).presentation = 'evoked';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(4).presentation = 'spontaneous1';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(5).presentation = 'spontaneous1';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(6).presentation = 'spontaneous1';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(7).presentation = 'spontaneous2';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(8).presentation = 'spontaneous2';
  STUDY.datasetinfo(1).trialinfo(9).presentation = 'spontaneous2';
```

The 'trialinfo' structure describes the property of each trial for
dataset number 1. Trial number 1, 2, 3 are trials of presentation type
'evoked', whereas trials 4, 5, 6 are trials of presentation type
'spontaneous1' and trials 7, 8, 9 are trials of presentation type
'spontaneous2'.

The function [std_makedesign.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=std_makedesign.m) (or its GUI equivalent
[pop_studydesign.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_studydesign.m)) uses the information defined above to create
STUDY designs. The content for the 'variable1' entry of the
[std_makedesign.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=std_makedesign.m) function can be either a field of 'datasetinfo' or
a field of 'datasetinfo.trialinfo'. Fields from 'trialinfo' are used in
a similar way to fields of STUDY.datasetinfo structure. For instance if
the STUDY.datasetinfo is defined as above.

To call std_makestudy(), simply write:

``` matlab
>> STUDY = std_makedesign(STUDY, ALLEEG, 1, 'variable1', 'presentation');
```

To select specific values for 'presentation'

``` matlab
>> STUDY = std_makedesign(STUDY, ALLEEG, 1, 'variable1', 'presentation', 'values1', { 'spontaneous1' 'spontaneous2' } );
```

### The STUDY.changrp sub-structure

The *STUDY.changrp* sub-structure is the equivalent of the the
*STUDY.cluster* structure for data channels. There is usually as many
element in *STUDY.changrp* as there are data channels. Each element of
*STUDY.changrp* contains one data channels and regroup information for
this data channel across all subjects. For instance, after precomputing
channel measures, typing *STUDY.changrp(1)* may return

``` matlab
>> STUDY.changrp

    ans =
    1x14 struct array with fields:
        name
        channels
        chaninds
```

The *changrp.name* field contains the name of the channel (i.e. 'FP1').
The *changrp.channels* field contains the name of the channels in this
group. This is because a group may contain several channels (for
instance for computing measures like ERP across a group of channels, or
for instance for computing the RMS across all data channels; note that
these features are not yet completely supported in the GUI).

### The STUDY.cluster sub-structure

The *STUDY.cluster* sub-structure stores information about the
clustering methods applied to the *STUDY* and the results of clustering.
Components identified for clustering in each *STUDY* dataset are each
assigned to one of the several resulting component clusters. Hopefully,
different clusters may have spatially and/or functionally distinct
origins and dynamics in the recorded data. For instance, one component
cluster may account for eye blinks, another for eye movements, a third
for central posterior alpha band activities, etc. Each of the clusters
is stored in a separate *STUDY.cluster* field, namely,
*STUDY.cluster(2)*, *STUDY.cluster(3)*, etc...

The first cluster, *STUDY.cluster(1)* , is composed of all components
from all datasets that were identified for clustering. It was created
when the *STUDY* was created and is not a result of clustering; it is the
*ParentCluster*. This cluster does not contain those components whose
equivalent dipole model exhibit a high percent variance from the
component's scalp map. These components have been excluded from
clustering (see [component clustering](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/component_clustering_tools.html)
tutorial for more information on how to exclude components from clustering).
Typing *STUDY.cluster* at the MATLAB command line returns

``` matlab
>> STUDY.cluster

    ans =

    1x23 struct array with fields:
        name [string]
        parent [integer]
        child [cell]
        comps [array]
        sets [array]
        algorithm [cell]
        preclust [struct]
        topo [2-D array]
        topox [array]
        topoy [array]
        topoall [cell]
        topopol [array]
        dipole [struct]
```

All this information (including the clustering results) may be accessed
from the MATLAB command line, or by using the interactive function [pop_clustedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.phpfile=pop_clustedit.m).

EEGLAB version 14 use to contain more information pertaining to each
cluster (such as the ERP, Spectrum and time-frequency data for a given
cluster) and this information would be made available in this structure
when a given cluster was plotted. These arrays were accessible to users
but were mostly cached values used for plotting purposes (so EEGLAB
would not have to reload them every time they were being plotted).

EEGLAB 2019 and later versions have adopted a simpler cache approach
where all the plotted data is stored in the STUDY.cache structure. If the data is available in the STUDY
cache, then the cached values are automatically returned. To
access this information, it is now recommended to use the return values
of the plotting functions std_erpplot, std_specplot, and std_erspplot -
if necessary disabling plotting. 

The *cluster.name* sub-field of each cluster is initialized according to
the cluster number, e.g. its index in the cluster array (for example:
'cls 2', 'cls 3', etc.). These cluster names may be changed to any
(e.g., more meaningful) names by the user via the command line or viathe [pop_clustedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_clustedit.m) interface.


The *cluster.comps* and *cluster.sets* fields describe which components
belong to the current cluster: *cluster.comps* holds the component
indices and *cluster.sets* the indices of their respective datasets.
Note also that several datasets may use the same
component weights and scalp maps -- for instance two datasets containing
data from different experimental conditions for the same subject and
collected in the same session, therefore using the same ICA
decomposition and the same component indices. As described further in a later section, *cluster.sets*
may contain several rows, each row containing a different dataset index.

The *cluster.preclust* sub-field is a sub-structure holding
pre-clustering information for the component contained in the cluster.
This sub-structure includes the pre-clustering method(s), their
respective parameters, and the resulting pre-clustering PCA data
matrices (for example, mean component ERPs, ERSPs, and/or ITCs in each
condition). Additional information about the *preclust* sub-structure is
given in the following section in which its use in further (hierarchic)
sub-clustering is explained.

The *cluster.centroid* field holds the cluster measure centroids for
each measure used to cluster the components (e.g., the mean or centroid
of the cluster component ERSPs, ERPs, ITCs, power spectra, etc. for each
*STUDY* condition), plus measures not employed in clustering but
available for plotting in the interactive cluster visualization and editing function, [pop_clustedit.m](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/locatefile.php?file=pop_clustedit.m).

The *cluster.algorithm* sub-field holds the clustering algorithm chosen
(for example *kmeans*) and the input parameters that were used in
clustering the pre-clustering data.

The *cluster.parent* and *cluster.child* sub-fields are used in
hierarchical clustering (see [component clustering](/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/component_clustering_tools.html) section of the tutorial).

The *cluster.child* sub-field contains indices of any clusters that were
created by clustering on components from this cluster (possibly,
together with additional cluster components). The *cluster.parent* field
contains the index of the parent cluster.

The *cluster.topo* field contains the average topography of a component
cluster. Its size is 67x67 and the coordinate of the pixels are given by
*cluster.topox* and *cluster.topoy* (both of them of size \[1x67\]).
This contains the interpolated activity on the scalp so different
subjects having scanned electrode positions may be visualized on the
same topographic plot. The *cluster.topoall* cell array contains one
element for each component and condition. The *cluster.topopol* is an
array of -1s and 1s indicating the polarity for each component.
Component polarities are not fixed, in the sense that inverting both one
component activity and its scalp map does not modify the back-projection
of the component to the data channels). The true scalp polarity is taken
into account when displaying component ERPs.

Finally, the *cluster.dipole* structure contains the centroid equivalent
dipole location of the component cluster. This structure is the same as
for a single component dipole (see the [ICA sources](/tutorials/09_source/DIPFIT.html) section of the tutorial).

Suppose that Cluster 2 (*artifacts*) comprises 15 components from four
of the datasets. The *cluster* structure will have the following
values:

``` matlab
>> STUDY.cluster(2)

    ans =
        name:       'artifacts'
        parent:     {'ParentCluster 1'}
        child:      {'muscle 4' 'eye 5' 'heart 6'}
        comps:      [6 10 15 23 1 5 20 4 8 11 17 25 3 4 12]
        sets:       [1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4]
        algorithm:  {'Kmeans' [2]}
        preclust:   [1x1 struct]
```

This structure field information says that this cluster has no other
*parent* cluster than the *ParentCluster* (as always, Cluster 1), but
has three *child* clusters (Clusters 4, 5, and 6). It was created by the
'Kmeans' *algorithm* and the requested number of clusters was '2'. Note
that as of EEGLAB 2019, we do not recommend using hierarchical
clustering. Often simple clustering can achieve similar or better results.

Preclustering details are stored in the *STUDY.cluster(2).preclust*
sub-structure (not shown above but detailed below). For instance, in
this case, the *cluster.preclust* sub-structure may contain the
PCA-reduced mean activity spectra (in each of the two conditions) for
all 15 components in the cluster.

The *cluster.preclust* sub-structure contains several fields, for
example:

``` matlab
>> STUDY.cluster(2).preclust

    ans =
        preclustdata:   [15x10 double]
        preclustparams: { {1x9 cell} }
        preclustcomps:  {1x4 cell}
```

The *preclustparams* field holds an array of cell arrays. Each cell
array contains a string that indicates what component measures were used
in the clustering (e.g., component spectra (*spec*), component ersps
(*ersp*), etc...), as well as parameters relevant to the measure. In
this example there is only one cell array, since only one measure (the
power spectrum) was used in the clustering.

For example:

``` matlab
>> STUDY.cluster(1).preclust.preclustparams

    ans =
        'spec' 'npca' [10] 'norm' [1] 'weight' [1] 'freqrange' [3 25]
```

The data measures used in the clustering were the component spectra in a
given frequency range ('' 'freqrange' [3 25]*), the spectra were
reduced to 10 principal dimensions (* 'npca' [10]*), normalized (*
'norm' [1]*), and each given a weight of 1 (* 'weight' [1]'). When
more than one method is used for clustering, then *preclustparams* will
contain several cell arrays.
The *preclust.preclustdata* field contains the data given to the
clustering algorithm (*Kmeans*). The data size width is the number of
ICA components (15) by the number of retained principal components of
the spectra (10) shown above. To prevent redundancy, only the measure
values of the 15 components in the cluster were left in the data. The
other components' measure data was retained in the other clusters.

The *preclust.preclustcomps* field is a cell array of size (nsubjects x
nsessions) in which each cell holds the components clustered (i.e., all
the components of the parent cluster).

#### Understanding the .sets, .comps substructures for *STUDY* clusters

In this part, *clust* will indicate the current cluster of interest.
vSTUDY.cluster(clust).sets* and *STUDY.cluster(clust).comps* fields contain
the list of component included in a given cluster.
*STUDY.cluster(clust).sets* is a \[datasets_with_same_ica x ncomps\]
matrix giving the index of the corresponding dataset in
*STUDY.datasetinfo* and corresponds to the components listed in
*STUDY.cluster(clust).comps*. *STUDY.cluster(clust).sets* and
*STUDY.cluster(clust).comps* have the same number of columns. However,
*STUDY.cluster(clust).sets* may have several rows if some datasets (from
the same subject) have the same ICA decomposition - an example is given
below of a cluster when each component is contained in two datasets (2
rows for the .sets field) containing identical ICA decompositions.

``` matlab
>> STUDY.cluster(clust)

    ans =
         name: 'Cls 3'
         sets: [2x13 double]
        comps: [23 5 13 47 38 3 50 5 12 4 11 3 5]
       parent: {'Parentcluster 1'}
```

If, for some reasons, the *STUDY.cluster(clust).sets* in not homogeneous –
some subjects have several datasets with the same decompositions and
other subjects have a different number of datasets with the same
decompositions, NaN are inserted for the missing datasets. However, the
presence of these missing datasets may break some analysis (warning
messages are displayed when relevant).

### STUDY data files

When pre-computing measures for a specific *STUDY* design, some files are
saved on disk. These files have names such as

``` matlab
  S01.daterp  % ERP data for data channels
  S01.icaerp  % ERP data for ICA components
  S01.datspec % Spetrum data for data channels
  S01.icaspec % Spetrum data for ICA components
  S01.dattimef % Single-trial time-frequency data for data channels
  S01.icatimef % Single-trial time-frequency data for ICA components
  S01.daterpim % ERPIMAGE data for data channels
  S01.icaerpim % ERPIMAGE data for ICA components
  S01.icatopo  % ICA component topographies
```

*S01* indicate that these files are for subject 1. The name of the
file is based on the naming convention in your *STUDY*. If the first
subject is named 'xx01' then the file name will start with 'xx01'. This
is also why subjects should not simply be numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...) as
most operating systems will not allow saving files that start with a
number.

Note that the file naming convention for versions of EEGLAB older than
2019 (EEGLAB 12, 13 and 14) was slightly different, and that the files
needed to be recomputed for each *STUDY* design (which is not the case for
EEGLAB 2019 and later versions). Also in old versions of EEGLAB, there
were two additional files *xxxx.datersp* and *xxxx.datitc* that contained
average time-frequency decompositions - since all files now contain
single-trial data, these files have been removed.

The file structure is similar for all file types listed below.

``` matlab
>> fileContent = load('-mat', 'S01.daterp');
>> fileContent

    ans = 
         chan1: [750×784 single]
         chan2: [750×784 single]
         chan3: [750×784 single]
         chan4: [750×784 single]
         chan5: [750×784 single]
         ...
        chan70: [750×784 single]

The fields *chanxx* represent ERP data for these channels. For ICA
components, the prefix is <i>comp</i> instead of <i>chan</i>. Each
channel data will contain an array for time x trials. Below a
description of the additional fields:

-   *labels*: This is a cell array of channel labels { 'Cz' 'Pz'
    ... }. This field is only present for data channels and is not
    present for ICA components.
-   *datatype*: This field contains the type of data saved in the file. More
    details are provided below.
-   *parameters*: The parameters used to compute each measure are also stored in the file, for example, the frequency range of the component spectra. Measure files are standard MATLAB files that may be read and processed using standard MATLAB commands. The variable names they contain should be self-explanatory.
-   *datafile*: the list of files used to compute this file.
-   *trialinfo*: information about each data trial. This is similar
    to the list of information in the field 'trialinfo' of
    *STUDY.dataset* (however it also includes information about
    condition, group and session which is stored separately in the
    *STUDY.dataset* structure).

The field datatype can take several values:

-   *ERP*: ERP data
-   *SPECTRUM*: SPECTRUM data (legacy)
-   *TIMEF*: time-frequency data
-   *ERPIMAGE*: ERPIMAGE data

Note that for ERPIMAGE data, the <i>comp</i> and <i>chan</i> fields may
contain a string of character. If this is the case, the string is
executed to load data. This avoids storing the single-trial
data multiple times if this is not necessary.
